Summary:
-	In conclusion, if people in Des Moines, IA and New York City, NY have similar tendencies, implanting a bike-sharing service in Des Moines, IA may yield equivalent financial results as the New York City, NY Citi Bikes. Iâ€™d like to add bike repair cost and replacement propensity over time.
